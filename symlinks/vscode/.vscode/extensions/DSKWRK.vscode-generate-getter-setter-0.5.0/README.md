## Install
Get VSCode and grab the extension from the [VSCode Extension Market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DSKWRK.vscode-generate-getter-setter)

## Settings

1. `genGetSet.scoped` (default: enabled) Only show private variables from current class based on cursor position.
2. `genGetSet.filter` (default: enabled) Only show private variables which do not have a getter/setter method.
3. `genGetSet.importTypings` (default: enabled) Create import lines based on definition files from /typings/.
3. `genGetSet.importNode` (default: enabled) Create import lines based on definition files from /node_modules/.
4. `genGetSet.classic` (default: disabled) use 'getValue' and 'setValue' instead of 'get value' and 'set value'.
5. `genGetSet.pathStringDelimiter` (default: ') sets which quote use to generate import path.
5. `genGetSet.spacedImportLine` (default: false) Adds spaces between the beginning and ending of the brackets in an import line.
6. `genGetSet.scanOnSave` (default: false) Scan the workspace for imports when a document is saved.
7. `genGetSet.ignoredImportList` (check settings) Imports like 'Promise' have many libraries but seldom need an import line.
7. `genGetSet.ignoredDictionaryList` (check settings) Dictionaries like 'vscode' and 'tsconfig' which do not need an import line.
7. `genGetSet.ignoredLibraryPaths` (check settings) Paths like 'dist' and 'src' which can be omitted in the import line.
7. `genGetSet.ignoredNodeLibraries` (check settings) A list of node module libraries like 'chrome' and 'node' which can be ignored as an import line.

## Usage

1. Just place your cursor within a TypeScript class definition in the text editor window
2. Open the command palette `ctrl+shift+P` / `cmd+shift+P`.
3. Search for 'Import', 'Generate Getter', 'Setter' or 'Constructor'

or

1. Just place your cursor within a TypeScript class definition in the text editor window
2. Press `alt+shift+G` for a quick selection pop-up
3. Select the preferred function from the pop-up menu

or

1. Click on the little Eye-Icon in your statusbar
2. Select the preferred function from the pop-up menu

The generated method will be placed at the cursors position.

## Best Practice

Best practice is naming your variables with a `_` for private use.
The extension will remove the `_` when generating the methods.

This: `private _name: string;`

Will render in:
```
public get name(): string {
    return this._name;
}

public set name(value: string) {
    this._name = value;
}
```

If there is no `_` the method will start with a `$`.

This: `private name: string;`

Will render in:
```
public get $name(): string {
    return this.name;
}

public set $name(value: string) {
    this.name = value;
}
```

## Known Problems

Always `type` your variables. Even when your variable is being initialized, else the extension cannot read the typing.
Always do this: `private _name: boolean = false;`

This is a TypeScript only extension.

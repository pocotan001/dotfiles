# Sublime Text Keymap for VS Code

This extension ports the most popular Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts to Visual Studio Code. After installing the extension and restarting VS Code your favorite keyboard shortcuts from Sublime Text are now available. 

## What keyboard shortcuts are included?

You can see all the keyboard shortcuts in the extension's contribution list.

## Why don't all Sublime Text commands work? 

VS Code has not implemented all features. Head on over to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3776) and let the VS Code team know what you'd like to see. 

You can install an extension for many of these features:

* [Expand Selection To Scope](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vittorioromeo.expand-selection-to-scope)
* [FontSize Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peterjuras.fontsize-shortcuts)
* [change case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case)
* [expand-region](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=letrieu.expand-region)
* [transpose](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=v4run.transpose)
* [Close HTML/XML tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag)
